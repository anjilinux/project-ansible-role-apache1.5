  Configure virtual hosts. Create files.

task_httpd-confd-vhosts_description: |

  Configure virtual hosts with the filter `encode_apache
  <https://galaxy.ansible.com/jtyr/config_encoder_filters>`_. See the template vhost2.j2.  Take the
  YAML configuration files from the directory ``apache_confd_dir_vhosts`` (7) at master and create
  files with the Apache virtual hosts in the directory (32) at the remote host. The created files
  will be included in the configuration file (42).

  
  **Include data from conf.d (3-17)**

  Include tasks from the file ``al_include_confd_vars_list`` (12) in the role ``vbotka.ansible_lib``
  (11). This task takes as parameters the directory with the YAML configuration files (7), and the
  type of the list (8) and returns the list with the YAML configurations of the virtual hosts stored
  in the variable ``al_include_confd_vars_list``. The variable can be printed (17) if debug is
  turned on ``apache_debug: true``. The parameters (7,8) are tested inside the included tasks.


  **Create directories for virtual hosts (25-27)**

  Include tasks from ``fn/httpd-confd-vhost-dirs.yml`` .


  **Configure virtual hosts in extra directory (29-38)**

  Create the Apache configuration files for the virtual hosts with the help of ``encode_apache``
  filter. Store the configuration file (32).


  **Include virtual hosts in httpd.conf (40-48)**
